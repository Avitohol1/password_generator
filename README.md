# password_generator
Built With JavaScript

The logic behind the algorithm:
1. Get the checked values from the form
2. Get the specified length of the password
3. For each character of the password call a random function (which returns a random letter, number or symbol)
4. Return the password

+ Custom Slider, Checkboxes and a Popup with pure CSS.
